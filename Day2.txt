### Exercise 3: Create Branch
1. Delete your local repo.

rm -r .git

2. clone your repo locally.

git clone git@github.com:Ma1482/xware-bootcamp.git


3. create new branch called `feature-add-new-week` from `main` branch.

git checkout -b branch-feature-add-new-week main
M	README.md
Switched to a new branch 'branch-feature-add-new-week'

4. create new folder called `week2` using command kine `mkdir`.
mkdir week2

5. Create new file inside `week2` called `README.md` using `touch`.

git add .

8. Commit the staged files.
git commit -m "test 2"

9. See your tracking status using `git status` to make sure all files are committed.
git status

10. merge your branch to `main` branch.
git checkout main 
git merge branch-branch-feature-add-new-week


11. Delete your branch.

git branch -d branch-feature-add-new-week 
Deleted branch branch-feature-add-new-week (was a355c8c).
